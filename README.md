# Welcome to the Windows Bridge for iOS Project
The Windows Bridge for iOS (also referred to as WinObjC) is a Microsoft open-source project that provides an Objective-C development environment for Visual Studio and support for iOS APIs. The bridge allows you to create Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that will run on many Windows devices by re-using your Objective-C code and iOS APIs alongside Windows 10 features like Cortana and Windows Notifications.

## Download and Installation
To use the bridge you'll need:
- The latest pre-built Windows Bridge for iOS SDK, that you can download [here](https://aka.ms/winobjc_latest). Click on the **winobjc.zip** file under *Downloads* to start the download and extract it to the local directory of your choice (example: C:\winobjc) when complete.
- **Windows 10**, build 10586 or higher. Validate your version number [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system).
- **Visual Studio 2015 Update 3** with Windows developer tools. Visual Studio 2015 Community is available for free [here](https://dev.windows.com/downloads). Select (at least) the following components during installation:
   1. Programming Languages -> Visual C++
   2. Universal Windows App Development Tools (all)
   
If you want to build the bridge from source instead, you'll also need to install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) before cloning the repo. For more detailed instructions, see the [Building From Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Building-From-Source) wiki page.

If you're having trouble downloading & installing the bridge, see the [Known Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC#known-issues) section below and check our [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/FAQ).

## Getting Started With the Bridge
### Importing your Xcode Project
When using the bridge, the first thing you'll want to do is generate a Visual Studio solution from your Xcode project:

1. Open the Windows Command Prompt (type **cmd** in the Start Menu to find it) and navigate to your Xcode project directory using the **cd** command. Note: use the directory containing your .workspace or .xcodeproj folder.

  ```
    C:\> cd C:\MyProject
  ```
2. Run the vsimporter tool from the *bin* directory of the bridge SDK you downloaded. This will generate the Visual Studio Solution:

  ```
    C:\MyProject> C:\winobjc\bin\vsimporter.exe
  ```
3. Open the generated Visual Studio solution with the command:

  ```
    C:\MyProject> MyProject.sln
  ```

For more detailed step by step instructions on how to import a project, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial) page of the wiki. For vsimporter options and known issues, check the [Using vsimporter](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Using-vsimporter) wiki page.

### Configuring Visual Studio
Once your solution is opened in Visual Studio, you'll want to enable Objective-C syntax highlighting and debugging.

- Installing the Syntax Highlighting Extension
  - To enable Objective-C syntax highlighting in Visual Studio, navigate to the *bin* directory of the SDK and double click on **objc-syntax-highlighting.vsix** to launch the installer.
- Setup Objective-C Debugging
  - To setup Objective-C debugging in Visual Studio, follow the instructions on the [Debugging](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Debugging) page of the wiki.
  
### Analyzing your App
After importing your project, we strongly suggest using the [App Analysis Tool](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bridges/ios/app-analyzer-tool) to have a better understanding of the compatibility of your app with the bridge.

### Building & Running the Samples
A great way to learn more about the bridge and its features is building and running the samples of the SDK, which contain many code examples. We recommend starting with the **WOCCatalog** sample app, which demonstrates an assortment of iOS and XAML UI controls:

1. Navigate to the *samples/WOCCatalog* directory of the bridge SDK
2. Double-click on the **WOCCatalog-WinStore10.sln** solution to open it in Visual Studio
3. In Visual Studio, right-click on the **WOCCatalog (Universal Windows)** project
4. Select **Set as StartUp project**
5. Use **Ctrl-F5** to build and run the app

For more detailed step by step instructions, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial) page of the wiki.
